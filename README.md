## Database as a Service (DaS) vs do it yourself

### DaS pros

- No maintaining overhead
- A lot of fancy features for free such as scaling, backups, multiple instances
- Does not require a lot of domain knowledge from cloud, databases, infra, monitoring etc
- Enterprise support

### DaS cons

- Might seem more expensive
- Might provide features that are not useful
- Vendor lock in
- The vendor might impose limitations on features / config
- Can be proprietary, i.e. a black box

### DIY pros

- No vendor lock in
- In house domain knowledge about the DB solution
- Flexible
- A known entity. The features and tech stack is known.
- Can be simple if that fits the requirements

### DIY cons

- Expensive (human resources, infra)
- Requires a lot of domain knowledge. Aquiring it might be away from tackling concrete business problems.
- Maintenance burden
- Most likely not as reliable or "fancy" as vendored solutions.
